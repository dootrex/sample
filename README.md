First off, thank you for giving me a chance of working with your stack. Your starting code was very well organized and made picking so many new things a lot easier.
I have only worked with react out of all the technologies used, so it took some time getting used to them, this limited the time I could spend on styling so instead I focused more on functionality and decided to get comments, completed and pagination working.
Though overwhelming in the beginning, I enjoyed the challenge and learned how everything was connected to each other. I think this is the best way to learn new things, by jumping in head first and learning by practice instead of watching someone do it in a tutorial.
I wasnâ€™t able to find the length of the todo list as it was an object which stopped me from dynamically setting the number of pages and instead I had to settle for a constant.
Ideally I would also like to break checkbox and comments into their own separate components.
